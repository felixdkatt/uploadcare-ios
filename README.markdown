# Uploadcare for iOS

**[Uploadcare](http://uploadcare.com)** is a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), providing file handling mechanisms for web sites and mobile applications.

**Uploadcare for iOS** is an open source Objective-C component that brings Uploadcare features to your iOS apps. It consists of two general parts: **UploadcareKit** and **Uploadcare Widget**.

**UploadcareKit** is a core-level abstract layer, responsible for API communication within upload and download tasks.

**Uploadcare Widget**, a major component of Uploadcare for iOS, is what a modern, cloud-aware file picker for iOS would be, if iOS had a notion of files. Since iOS doesn't, you can think of Uploadcare Widget as a *thing* picker â€“ a drop-in component, that allows your users to select and upload their *things* (photos, documents, whatever you want them to) to your service, via Uploadcare.

Here's what it looks like:

## Quickstart

### Install

Uploadcare for iOS uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), a library dependency management tool for Objective-C projects. To install Uploadcare for iOS in your project, just add the following line to your [Podfile](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/A-Podfile):

```ruby
pod 'Uploadcare'
```

Then, run `pod install` in your project directory.

Make sure to use the `.xcworkspace` file from now on.

### Setup
#### Environment

Import `Uploadcare.h` header to your implementation.
Set up uploadcare public key as following in your application delegate:
```objc
#import <Uploadcare/Uploadcare.h>

/* ... */

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [[UCClient defaultClient] setPublicKey:<#your key#>];
    return YES;
}
```

#### iCloud entitlements
Uploadcare widget uses `UIDocumentMenuViewController`, so you need to enable iCloud in your application. 
Go to **Target** -> **Capabilities** and enable iCloud. Set both `Key-value storage` and `iCloud Documents` options enabled:
![iCloud settings](https://ucarecdn.com/738d9b6f-517d-417c-b048-d0d08a411e80/)

#### Custom url scheme
Uploadcare widget uses `SFSafariViewController` on iOS 9+ and `UIWebView` on prior versions
for authentification. In this case it should handle url callbacks through custom url
scheme from application delegate methods:

```objc
// IOS 9+
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<NSString *,id> *)options {
    return [[UCClient defaultClient] handleURL:url];
}

// IOS 8
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url {
    return [[UCClient defaultClient] handleURL:url];
}
```
In order to add custom url scheme, perform the following steps:
* Go to **Target** -> **Info** -> **URL types**
* Add new url scheme with the following format: uc-\<public key\>
* The final result should look similar to this:

#### `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` on iOS 10
Uploadcare widget uses `UIImagePickerController` to upload files from camera roll. Don't forget to add  `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` key to your project `Info.plist` file to prevent app from crash in runtime.

### Show
#### Init and present widget

To display the Uploadcare Widget, you must create and initialize an instance of [`UCMenuViewController`](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-ios/UploadcareWidget/UCMenuViewController.h) by invoking `initWithProgress:completion:` method:

```objc
#import <Uploadcare/Uploadcare.h>

/* ... */

UCMenuViewController *menu = [[UCMenuViewController alloc] initWithProgress:^(NSUInteger bytesSent, NSUInteger bytesExpectedToSend) {
    // handle progress here
} completion:^(NSString *fileId, id response, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        // handle success
    } else {
        // handle error
    }
}];
    
    
```

Then, present it with `presentFrom:` method:

```objc
[menu presentFrom:self];
```

### Customization

You can easily customize your social networks list apperance by implementing your own menu.
In order to receive available social sources, you can use `fetchSocialSourcesWithCompletion:` method from
`UCSocialManager`.
After you receive a list of social sources, you can choose one and use it for instantiating
`UCGalleryVC` with the following method:
```objc
- (id)initWithSource:(UCSocialSource *)source
           rootChunk:(UCSocialChunk *)rootChunk
            progress:(UCProgressBlock)progress
          completion:(UCWidgetCompletionBlock)completion;
```

### Core level features only

In order to integrate core level features only, such as local and remote file upload operations, 
you can use the following subspec:

```ruby
pod 'Uploadcare/Core'
```

Please notice, that `Uploadcare.h` header won't be included in this case, so you'll have to use `UploadcareKit.h` instead.
